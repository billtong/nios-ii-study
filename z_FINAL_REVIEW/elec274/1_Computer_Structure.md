# Computer Architecture
- specifications of a set of instructions and the behavior of the hardware units to execute these instructions
# Five basic units of a computer system
- input, ouput, control, arithmetic/logic, memory
# Instruction set architecture
- The conceptual structure and the functional behavior of the computer system as seen by the assembly language programmer, includes machine instructions and their format, addressing modes, data representation, storage organization
# Purpose of the PC register and the IR register
- Programer Counter points to the next instruction to be executed in the execution sequence
- Instruction Register holds the most recent fectched instruction in the memory to feed the control logic that generate appropriate signals
