# two distinguishing characteristics of RISC-style instruction sets
- instructions are one word in length
- arithmetic operations require operands to be in registers
# RISC-style instruction encode
## How many address bits are encoded in Call Instruction
- 26 address bits (= 32 bit instruction - 6 bit operation code)
