# lab3 specs
Make the following changes. After printing "ELEC371 Lab3\n" print 10 blank spaces using PrintString() before the loop. In the loop after detecting that the flag is set, remove printing the '*' character. Instead, call a new function switches(). In that new function, print 10 backspace characters '\b' to move th ecursor backwards. Read the switches data register. Start with value (1<<9) to AND with the switch data, print '#' if corresponding switch is on  or ':' if off. RIght-shift the mask value and repeat AND/printing in a loop until the shifted mask value and repeat AND/printing in a loop until the shifted mask value reaches 0. After the loop, check if all ten switches are on. If so, turn on all 32 LEDs on the 7-segment displays, otherwise turn all 32 LEDs off.
